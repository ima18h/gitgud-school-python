# Basic testing / git school project
I made this basic project for a school course at UiO, University of Oslo. 
The purpose , for me, was to learn about testing. 

## Lessons Learned
- Learned about ways to make testing clean using pytest. 
- Testing can be used as a development strategy. 
Tests are written first, then the functions are implemented.
