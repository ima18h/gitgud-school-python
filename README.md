# Project 0
First project in IN1910 about testing with pytest and git

- Repo url : https://github.uio.no/IN1910/H21_project0_imadha.git


## Lessons Learned
Learned about git and pytest. 


## Notes
I dont think it was needed to define a function for each test. I have all asserts for a certain function inside one defined test function. 
I know it can be better to not do that.
